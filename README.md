# Cat and Dog Adoption Trends
This is a data visualization project from Springboard that I am quite proud of. In the course, I wrangled data and created visualizations through Jupyter notebooks and created presentation slides. This part of the project was completed in January 2023. There will be a Tableau dashboard of this project soon.

### The Dataset:

Dataset is from kaggle.com, original source is from the Bloomington Animal Shelter. It includes data from January 2017 - August 2019.

Data wrangling steps included converted appropriate data into datetime objects and converting age from string to float. While Bloomington shelter takes in rabbits and other small animals, for this project, we focus only on cats and dogs.

### Questions:
Are cats or dogs more likely to be dropped off at the shelter?
<br>
Are there more animals of a specific age, breed, or color?
<br>
What is the most common reason why animals are dropped off at the shelter?
<br>
Are there any trends or seasonality for shelter intakes, movements, or returns?
